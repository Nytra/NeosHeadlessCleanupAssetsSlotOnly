# HeadlessCustomAssetCleanup

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) Headless Client that replaces the automatic world asset cleanup with a custom version that doesn't break some materials, textures and other stuff in the world.

Instead of the normal cleanup, it will do "Cleanup Unused Assets" and "Cleanup Empty Slots" in the same way that the Asset Optimization Wizard does it.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [HeadlessCustomAssetCleanup.dll](https://github.com/Nytra/NeosHeadlessCustomAssetCleanup/releases/latest/download/HeadlessCustomAssetCleanup.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\HeadlessClient\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
